# n-puzzle ðŸ§©

## Getting started

You will need node and npm installed globally on your machine.

### Package manager

I use `yarn` as package manager. [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) installs the specified version defined in `package.json` so you do not need to install it yourself.

### Install project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/amandaflod/n-puzzle.git
cd n-puzzle
yarn
```

### Run the dev server

```sh
yarn dev
```

Go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.
